      SUBROUTINE SDECON(I1,I2,I3,I4,I5,I6,I7,I8,I9,I10,I11,I12)
C     PDECON PERFORMS SPIKING DECONVOLUTION IN THE AP.
C  PDECON DESIGNS A LEAST SQUARES PREDICTION ERROR FILTER
C  AND APPLIES THE FILTER TO THE ENTIRE TRACE.
C
C  THE COMPUTATIONAL STEPS ARE:
C  1)  COMPUTE THE POSITIVE LAGS OF THE AUTOCORRELATION OF THE DESIGN WINDOW.
C  2)  COMPUTE AND ADD TO THE ZERO LAG THE PERCENTAGE PREWHITENING.
C  3)  COMPUTE THE CROSSCORRELATION BETWEEN THE DESIGN WINDOW AND THE DESIRED
C      OUTPUT.
C  4)  SOLVE THE NORMAL EQUATIONS USING THE WIENER-LEVINSON ALGORITHIM.
C  5)  NEGATE THE FILTER COEFS. AND MOVE THE FILTER DOWN THE ARRAY THE
C      PREDICTION DISTANCE.
C  6)  PUT A ONE IN THE FIRST FILTER POINT
C  7)  ZERO THE PREDICTION DISTANCE -1 POINTS AFTER THE FIRST POINT.
C  8)  FILTER THE ENTIRE TRACE.
C
C  ARGUMENTS:
C  I1 = DESIGN - THE AP LOCATION OF THE BEGINNING OF THE DESIGN WINDOW.
C  I2 = NDPTS  - THE NUMBER OF DATA POINTS IN THE DESIGN WINDOW
C  I3 = TRACE  - THE AP LOCATION OF THE BEGINNING OF THE APPLICATION WINDOW.
C  I4 = NPTS   - THE NUMBER OF DATA POINTS TO FILTER (THE LENGTH OF THE
C                APPLICATION WINDOW).
C  I5 = WHITEN - THE AP LOCATION OF A 3 WORD ARRAY CONTAINING:
C            1) THE FRACTION OF THE ZERO LAG TO USE AS PREWHITING (PERCENT/100.)
C            2) THE NUMBER ONE (1)
C            3) A SCRATCH LOCATION FOR PDECON TO PUT A -1 INTO!
C  I6 = NFPTS  - THE NUMBER OF FILTER POINTS IN THE FILTER.  THE AUTOCORRELATION
C                AND THE CROSSCORRELATION AND THE FILTER WILL BE NFPTS LONG.
C  I7 = AUTO   - THE AP LOCATION OF WHERE PDECON CAN PUT THE AUTOCORRELATION AND
C                THE CROSSCORELATION.  MUST BE 2*NFPTS LONG.
C  I8 = PREDIC - THE PREDTICTION DISTANCE.
C  I9 = FILT   - THE AP LOCATION OF WHERE PDECON CAN PUT THE FILTER POINTS.
C                (MUST BE NFPTS+PREDICTION DISTANCE LONG).
C  I10= ERROPR - THE AP LOCATION OF WHERE PDECON CAN PUT THE ERROR OPERATOR.
C                (MUST BE NPTS LONG).
C  I11= RESULT - THE AP LOCATION OF WHERE PDECON CAN LEAVE THE RESULTS.
C                (MUST BE NPTS LONG).
C  I12= SCRATC - THE AP LOCATION OF A SCRATCH ARRAY AT LEAST NPTS+NFPTS LONG.
