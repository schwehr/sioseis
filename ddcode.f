      SUBROUTINE DDCODE(ALPHA,NCHARS,DREAL,ISTAT)
C     DDCODE RETURNS A REAL*8 or DOUBLE PRECISION NUMBER, GIVEN A
c  STRING OF CHARACTERS.  THIS RESEMBLES
C  THE OLD DECODE STATEMENT FOUND IN PRE-FORTRAN 77.  DCODE DOES NOT WORRY ABOUT
C  INTEGERS HOPING THAT THE CALLING ROUTINE CAN FIX IT IF IT NEEDS TO BE, AND
C  THAT ROUND OFFS WON'T HURT.  THIS ROUTINE ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IT DOES
C  NOT BOMB IF THE ALPHA IS NOT A NUMBER!  THE MESSAGE IS IN ENGLISH TOO!
C
C  ARGUMENTS:
C    ALPHA - THE STRING OF CHARACTERS TO BE CONVERTED TO AN INTERNAL FLOATING
C            POINT NUMBER.  THIS MUST BE OF TYPE CHARACTER.   CHARACTER* (*)
C    NCHARS - THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN THE STRING TO BE DECODED.  INTEGER*4
C    DREAL - THE DOUBLE PRECISION (REAL*8) NUMBER DECODED BY DCODE.  THIS VALUE
C            IS RETURNED BY DCODE.   REAL*8
C    ISTAT - THE STATUS OF THE DECODE.    INTEGER*4
C          =0, THE DECODE HAD AN ERROR.  THE RETURN VALUE AREAL IS MEANINGLESS.
C              THE "NUMBER" HAD A NON-NUMERIC IN IT.
C          =1, THE CHARACTER STRING WAS AN ALPHA (THE FIRST CHARACTER WAS NOT
C              NUMERIC).  THE RETURNED VALUE OF AREAL IS MEANINGLESS.
C          =2, THE DECODE WAS SUCCESSFUL.
