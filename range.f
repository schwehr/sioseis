      FUNCTION RANGE(GXP,GGX,GNEED)
C    RANGE CALCULATES THE RANGE (SHOT TO RECEIVER DISTANCE) FROM A SET OF
C  GROUP-DISTANCE PAIRS AND/OR THE GROUP-GROUP DISTANCE.  THIS ROUTINE ASSUMES
C  THAT THE SEISMIC LINE IS STRAIGHT!!!  RANGES ARE INTERPOLATED BETWEEN
C  GROUPS SPECIFIED AND ARE EXTRAPOLATED USING GGX FOR GROUPS LESS THAN THE
C  FIRST GIVEN OR GREATER THAN THE LAST GIVEN.  EXTRAPOLATION USES GGX*
C  (GROUP GIVEN - GROUP WANTED)+(RANGE OF THE GROUP GIVEN).
C
C  ARGUMENTS:
C    GXP   - AN ARRAY OF GROUP-DISTANCE PAIRS.  AT LEAST ONE PAIR MUST BE GIVEN.
C            EACH PAIR MUST HAVE THE GROUP NUMBER FIRST AND THE RANGE (DISTANCE)
C            SECOND.  THE GXP SET MUST BE TERMINATED BY A NEGATIVE GROUP NUMBER.
C            THUS, ODD ELEMENTS IN THE GXP ARRAY ARE GROUP NUMBERS AND THE EVEN
C            ELEMENTS ARE THE CORRESPONDING RANGES.  GROUP NUMBERS MUST INCREASE
C            IN THE GXP ARRAY.
C    GGX   - THE CONSTANT GROUP TO GROUP DISTANCE.
C    GNEED - THE GROUP NUMBER OF THE RANGE WANTED.
C
C  EXAMPLE 1:
C  GIVEN GXP(1)=24., GXP(2)=450., GXP(3)=-1.,  GGX=300. AND GNEED=20.
C  THEN RANGE=(24-20)*300.+450.=1650.
