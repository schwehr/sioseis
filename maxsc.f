      SUBROUTINE MAXSC(TRACE,DEFF,NSAMPS,ITYPE,PEAK,TROUGH)
C****
C    A SUBROUTINE TO SCALE AN ARRAY SO THAT SOME SAMPLE IS +/- DEFF*RNIBS BIG.
C THIS IS A SCALING ROUTINE FOR VERSATEC SEISMIC TRACE PLOTS.
C ARGUMENTS:
C        TRACE  - THE ARRAY CONTAINING THE DATA.  THE SCALED DATA IS PLACED IN
C                 TRACE ALSO, THEREBY CLOBBERING THE ARRAY.
C        DEF    - THE VALUE OF THE LARGEST VALUE AFTER SCALING.  THE LARGEST
C                 VALUE WILL BE SCALED TO DEF.  ( ALSO THE DEFLECTION OF A TRACE
C        NSAMPS - NUMBER OF SAMPLES (16 BIT INTEGER)
C        ITYPE  - TYPE OF SCALE
C               =1, DELECTION IS MEASURED FROM THE PEAK TO THE ZERO LINE
C               =2, DEFLECTION IS MEASURED AS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PEAK AND TROUGH
C        PEAK   - THE LARGEST POSITIVE VALUE WITHIN ARRAY TRACE
C        TROUGH - THE MOST NEGATIVE VALUE IN ARRAY TRACE
C   NOTE THAT BOTH PEAK AND TROUGH ARE VALUES RETURNED BY MAXSC, THAT IS THEY
C  ARE SET BY MAXSC.
