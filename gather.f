      SUBROUTINE GATHER(LTRACE,trace,itrace,lscr,scr,iscr,ISIG,NREADY)
C     GATHER PERFORMS A GATHER (OR TRACE COLLECT OR TRACE SORT) OF SEISMIC TRACES
C  ACCORDING TO A BIN NUMBER (OR RP NUMBER FOR EXAMPLE).  EACH OUTPUT GATHER
C  IS ADDITIONALLY SORTED SO THAT SUCCESSIVE TRACES WITHIN THE GATHER HAVE
C  INCREASING MAGNITUDE OF RANGE.
C     THE INPUT TO GATHER IS ONE TRACE PER CALL.  THE TRACE MUST HAVE THE BIN
C  NUMBER IN BYTES 21-24 AND THE RANGE IN BYTES 37-40 (THIS CORRESPONDS TO
C  A TRACE AND TRACE HEADER IN SEGY TAPE FORMAT).  THE TRACE AND HEADER MUST
C  BE CONTIGUOUS AND THE TOTAL LENGTH IS GATHERED.  EACH TRACE MUST
C  BE NO MORE THAN NWRDS. (NWRDS MUST NOT CHANGE WITHIN A JOB).
C     THE OUTPUT OF GATHER IS A DISC FILE CONTAINING A SET OF TRACES
C  REPRESENTING ONE OR MORE BIN NUMBERS (RP'S).  A GATHER IS OUTPUT ONLY WHEN
C  THE WHOLE GATHER IS COMPLETE.  THUS, THE CALLING PROGRAM MUST CHECK TO SEE
C  IF ANY OUTPUT IS READY OR NOT.  THE OUTPUT DISC FILE CONTAINING THE GATHERS
C  IS STARTED FROM THE BEGINNING ON EACH ENTRY TO PROGRAM GATHER (THUS, THE
C  CALLING PROGRAM MUST MOVE THE GATHERS OUT OF THE OUTPUT FILE BEFORE THE NEXT
C  CALL TO PROGRAM GATHER).  THE NUMBER OF TRACES IN THE OUTPUT FILE IS NREADY
C  AND MAY REPRESENT MORE THAN ONE GATHER.
C     GATHER SETS A -1 IN TRACE HEADER WORD IBUF(91) WHEN THE TRACE IS THE LAST
C  OF AN R.P. (THIS TELLS SUBROUTINE STACK THAT IT'S THE END OF THE R.P.)
C     AN RP OF 524272 INDICATES THAT THE TRACE DOES NOT BELONG TO A GATHER BIN
C  AND WILL BE DROPPED.
C
C  ARGUMENTS:
C
C  TRACE  - THE BUFFER OR ARRAY TO BE GATHERED.  THE TRACE MUST BE NWRDS LONG.
C  LTABLE - AN ARRAY NEEDED TO HOLD THE TABLE OF BIN NUMBER, DISC ADDRESS,
C           RANGE TRIPLETS.  THIS ARRAY MUST BE 3*MAXRPS*MAXTRS 32 BIT WORDS LONG.
C           THE CALLING PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY TABLE BETWEEN CALLS TO GATHER.
C  SCR    - A SCRATCH ARRAY NWRDS (32 BIT WORDS) LONG.  SCR MAY BE MODIFIED
C           BY THE CALLING PROGRAM BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE CALLS TO SUBROUTINE GATHER.
C  ISIG   - WHEN SET TO ONE, INDICATES TO SUBROUTINE GATHER THAT ARRAY TRACE DOES
C           NOT HAVE A TRACE AND THAT ALL THE GATHERS HELD BY IT ARE TO
C           BE FLUSHED OUT TO THE OUTPUT FILE.
C  NREADY - THE NUMBER OF TRACES GATHERED INTO THE OUTPUT FILE BY SUBROUTINE
C           GATHER.  NREADY IS SET BY GATHER.  NREADY MAY CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE
C           GATHER.  A ZERO INDICATES THAT NO GATHER IS READY IN THE OUTPUT
C           FILE.
C
C  COMMON NEEDED:
C     COMMON /TCOL/ LSTRP,LRPINC,NWRDS,IOUNIT,MAXRPS,MAXTRS,MINTRS
C  WHERE:
C  LSTRP  - THE STARTING BIN NUMBER (32 BIT INTEGER).  MAY BE NEGATIVE, ZERO,
C           OR POSITIVE.
C  LRPINC - THE INCREMENT OR SKIP CYCLE BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE BIN NUMBERS.  THE
C           ADDITIVE TO LSTRP TO GET THE SECOND BIN NUMBER.  32 BIT INTEGER.
C           MAY BE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, BUT MUST NOT BE ZERO.
C  NWRDS  - THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SAMPLES PER TRACE IN THE JOB.  THIS SHOULD BE
C           TRACE LENGTH PLUS THE TRACE HEADER LENGTH.  NWRDS MUST NOT CHANGE
C           BETWEEN CALLS (IT WILL BE IGNORED IF IT DOES!)
C  IOUNIT - THE OUTPUT UNIT NUMBER OF THE DISC FILE WHERE THE OUTPUT GATHERS
C           WILL BE PUT.  THE CALLING PROGRAM MUST OPEN THE FILE AND SET THE
C           UNIT NUMBER.
C  MAXRPS - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BINS (OR RP'S) THAT NEED TO BE HELD ON
C           THE DISC AT ANY ONE TIME.  IN MARINE WORK THE NUMBER OF TRACES
C           PER SHOT WILL SUFFICE SINCE NO TWO UNGATHERED TRACES WITH THE SAME
C           RP NUMBER ARE MORE THAN A CABLE LENGTH AWAY.
C  MAXTRS - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TRACES ANY ONE GATHER CAN HAVE.  IN RP GATHERS
C           THIS IS THE MAXIMUM CDP ALLOWED.
C  MINTRS - THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF TRACES EACH GATHER CAN HAVE.  IF MINTRS=0 AND
C           NO INPUT TRACES CONTRIBUTE TO A GIVEN GATHER, THAT GATHER WILL NOT BE
C           OUTPUT.

C                   NOVEMBER 1979
c    changed July 14, 1990 to add arguments trace, itrace, scr, iscr and use 'em
c   mod 12 Jan 90 - use maxtrs instead of maxrps for table search limits
c                    when looking for space in the output gather.
c   mod 28 Apr 92 - Drop dead traces (ibuf(15) = 2)
c  mod 16 Nov 92 - Move dead trace check to be first, in case the first
c                  trace is dead and has a bad trace header.
c  mod 3 May 95 - compute nsamps = nwrds - numhdr when generating mintrcs
c  mod 25 Apr 96 - Increase the max allowable traces (maxrps*maxtrs) and
c                - Add a check for exceeding max!
c  mod 2 Oct 97 - Set numdat/nsamps when flushing because it may not be
c            set coming in when isig is 0 (e.g. process input did that!)
c  mod May 06 - Delete all the restart stuff (frp).
c             - Redo the maximum maxtrs/maxrps messages.
c             - Check for gathers with more than 2G samples, which will
c               cause the 32 bit disk address to blow up.  podisc uses
c               a 8 byte integer to convert to bytes.
c  mod 25 Sep 08 - Use unsigned integer arithmetic for disc addresses
c  mod 9 Oct 08 - unsigned "-" was wrong for EOG. -nwrds+50 = -(nwrds-50)
c  mod 25 Aug 09 - Change from podisc to podiscun
c  mod 30 Aug 09 - Cygwin didn't like podiscun, so made it podiscun.
c  mod 7 May 10 - Argh.  unsigned disk address logic fails because a negative
c                 disk address was used to indicate the slot was empty.
c                 Change ltable(2) to be a trace counter rather than disk addr.
c  mod 3 Jun 10 - Add warning if FRP is far away from the first rp read.
