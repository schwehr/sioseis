      SUBROUTINE CONVOL(ITYPE,BUFIN,NSAMPS,FILTER,NFPTS,OBUF,NOUT)
C     CONVOL PERFORMS TIME DOMAIN CONVOLUTION AND CORRELATION BETWEEN ARRAYS
C BUFIN AND FILTER.  THE OUTPUT IS RETURNED IN OBUF AND IS  VARIABLE IN LENGTH
C DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF OPERATION REQUESTED.
C
C ARGUMENTS:
C        ITYPE  - TYPE OF CONVOLUTION OR CORRRELATION DESIGNATOR.
C               =-2,  PARTIAL CONVOLUTION.  THIS TYPE IS DESIGNED FOR ZERO PHASE
C                     FILTERING WHERE NEGATIVE TIME AFTER FILTERING IS NOT WANTED
C                     THIS ASSUMES THAT THE FIRST TIME OF THE DATA IS 0 AND THE
C                     FILTER IS SYMMETRICAL.
C               =-1,  FULL CONVOLUTION.  THE TIME REFERENCE OF THE FIRST OUTPUT
C                     POINT IS T1+T2, WHERE T1 IS THE TIME OF THE FIRST SAMPLE
C                     IN BUFIN AND T2 IS THE TIME OF THE FIRST SAMPLE IN ARRAY
C                     FILTER.  E.G.  IF A ZERO PHASE FILTER HAS TIME POINTS -19
C                     TO +19 AND THE FIRST SAMPLE IN BUFIN IS AT TIME 0, THEN
C                     THE TIME OF THE FIRST OUTPUT SAMPLE IS -19.
C               =+1,  FULL CORRELATION.  BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE LAGS ARE
C                     COMPUTED.  CORRELATIONS ARE EVEN FUNCTIONS, THEREFORE HALF
C                     CORRELATIONS GIVE THE SAME INFORMATION AND SHOULD BE USED
C                     MOST OF THE TIME.
C               =+2,  HALF CORRELATION.  ONLY THE RIGHT HALF OF THE CORRELATION
C                     IS PERFORMED.  THIS TYPE IS DESIGNED FOR VIBROSEIS
C                     DESWEEPING WHERE A FULL CORRELATION WOULD BE A TOTAL
C                     WASTE OF TIME!!!
C        BUFIN  - INPUT ARRAY TO BE FILTERED (CONVOLVED) OR CORRELATED.
C        NSAMPS - THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES IN BUFIN TO FILTER.
C        FILTER - AN ARRAY OF REAL FILTER WEIGHTS.  AN ARRAY OF VALUES TO BE
C                 CORRELATED.
C        NFPTS  - THE NUMBER OF FILTER POINTS IN THE FILTER ARRAY.
C        OBUF   - THE OUTPUT ARRAY.
C        NOUT   - THE NUMBER OF OUTPUT SAMPLES TO GENERATE.  FOR CONVOLUTION
C                 THIS SHOULD NORMALLY BE MSAMPS+MPTS.  FOR CORRELATION THIS IS
C                 THE NUMBER OF LAGS TO OUTPUT, IT MIGHT BE  MIN0(MSAMPS,MPTS).
